Dear Person Reading This Commit Message:

I have used Nodejitsuâ€™s platform for over half a year now, and I would love to work with you to make it even better.

Node.js has been my passion for over a year now. I have used it for multiple projects and too many small hacks to count. I have used it as a [proxy to expose select internal web services to the internet to allow traveling CEOs to approve marketing promotions away from the office](https://github.com/Elzair/promotionapprover). The system authenticated users via an OAuth-like scheme I created. I have used Node.js to power a [website for a local nonprofit group](https://github.com/Elzair/cltar), and I have used it as a [backend for a web-based vegan and vegetarian restaurant finding app](https://github.com/Elzair/humane-eating). I have also tinkered with the internals of Node.js and its dependencies: v8 and [libuv](https://github.com/Elzair/libuv-examples).

I have programmed for over ten years and have both front-end and back-end development experience. I have used a variety of other backend frameworks: Django, CodeIgniter, Kohana, Meteor.js, the Spring Framework, and ASP.NET. I have made extensive use of jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile, Twitter Bootstrap, Backbone.js, Underscore.js, Knockout.js, and Angular.js in my front-end development work. I also have experience with relational databases, such as MySQL and SQL Server, and NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Redis. 

I have been an active Linux user since 2003, so I have extensive Linux administration experience. 

I appreciate your taking the time to review my resume and experience. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Philip Woods
